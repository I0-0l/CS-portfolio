                <p>The city's historical depth is encapsulated in its iconic landmarks. The Forbidden City, a palatial complex that served as the home of emperors for centuries, stands as a majestic reminder of China's imperial history. The Temple of Heaven, a stunning example of Ming Dynasty architecture, is not only a site of historical significance but also a serene park where locals practice Tai Chi at dawn.</p>
